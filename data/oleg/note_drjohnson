Subjective:

The patient presented today with complaints of persistent headaches and pain in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area. The headaches have been occurring for the past three months and are described as a dull, constant ache on the right side of the head, occasionally radiating to the left. The patient rates the pain as a 6 out of 10 on the pain scale. The TMJ pain is also constant and is described as a sharp, shooting pain that worsens with chewing or yawning. The patient has also noticed popping and clicking sounds when opening and closing the mouth.

Objective:

Upon examination, there was tenderness and swelling in the TMJ area. The patient's jaw movement was limited and deviated to the right upon opening. There was also evidence of teeth grinding (bruxism) and muscle tenderness in the temporalis and masseter muscles.

Assessment:

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, it is likely that the patient is suffering from Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMJ) and associated headaches. The limited jaw movement, tenderness, and popping/clicking sounds are indicative of TMJ dysfunction. The headaches are likely a result of the TMJ disorder, as well as possible muscle tension and stress.

Plan:

Prescribe a course of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help reduce pain and inflammation in the TMJ area.
Refer the patient to a physical therapist for jaw exercises and relaxation techniques to help improve jaw movement and reduce muscle tension.
Consider prescribing a mouth guard to wear at night to prevent teeth grinding and reduce stress on the TMJ.
Encourage the patient to practice stress-reducing activities such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises.
Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to assess progress and adjust treatment plan as needed.
