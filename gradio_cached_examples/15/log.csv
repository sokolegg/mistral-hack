Based on your medical history and current treatment plan, it's recommended that you avoid drinking alcohol for the next three months.

It's important to give your body the best chance to heal and recover, so try to abstain from alcohol during this period. Instead, focus on stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises, which can also help alleviate your TMJ symptoms and headaches.
